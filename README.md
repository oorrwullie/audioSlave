# audioSlave

**audioSlave** is a lightweight Go service that monitors your Mac‚Äôs lock/unlock state and automatically controls a HomeKit plug based on your DAC connection status.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Detects macOS lock/unlock events (using `lockscreen-watcher`)
- Verifies that a specific DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) is:
  - Connected
  - Operating at a specific sample rate (via `dac-checker`)
- Turns **ON** a HomeKit smart plug on unlock if DAC is ready
- Turns **OFF** the plug on lock
- Easy `configure` wizard ‚Äî no file editing needed
- Auto-starts on login using a LaunchAgent
- Supports log rotation with `newsyslog`

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oorrwullie/audioSlave.git
cd audioSlave
```

### 2. Install dependencies

You‚Äôll need [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (pre-installed on macOS).

Install Go using Homebrew if needed:

```bash
brew install go
```

### 3. Build and install

```bash
make install
```

This will:

- Build the `audioSlave`, `lockscreen-watcher`, and `dac-checker` binaries
- Install them into `/usr/local/bin`
- Copy the LaunchAgent to `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
- Install the log rotation config to `/etc/newsyslog.d/`
- Create a log directory at `/tmp/audioSlave-logs/`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è First-Time Configuration

After installing, run:

```bash
make configure
```

This will guide you through:

- Selecting your DAC device
- Setting the expected sample rate
- Providing your Homebridge base URL and credentials
- Selecting the HomeKit plug to control

Your configuration will be saved to:

```bash
~/.config/audioSlave/config.json
```

Credentials are stored securely in your macOS Keychain.
